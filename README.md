# SE2AA4_Projects
These are my completed assignments from SFWRENG2AA4 Winter 2021. New assignments are released every year in the Winter term.

The projects are not intended for academic use beyond the SFWRENG 2AA4 Winter 2021 term. If you are a student looking for examples of the course work take a look at Dr.Smith's public course pages: https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/smiths/se2aa4_cs2me3

To take a look at the specifications given to us check out the links below:
The gitignores, makefiles and docignores do not belong to me.

A4: This assignment was a bit different. We had the opportunity to make our own specifications. Timing constraints prevented me from formalizing the whole thing but it was still a very fun project.
